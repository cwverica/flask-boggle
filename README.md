# Running tests

Prep the environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests (inside `test.py`):

```
python -m unittest test.FlaskTests
```

 Thanks for writing this readme. I'm just messing around with markdown. Enjoy this
 jocular writing of ridiculousness... or not.

### Hello, Welcome to the readme file.

First and foremost, read the requirements.txt to set up your virtual environment.  
I cannot tell you how many times I forget to activate mine, and if you don't have 
the same requirements, you're not gonna have a good time.

Second, the home page is at "*/home*" not just "*/*".  
Maybe I did this for a reason. Maybe it's just to mess with your head. Maybe it's 
just because I wanna go home. Maybe there's no method to my maddness, I'll never tell.

Tests can be run as a unit test using the python module, and there is only one test file.  
I didn't write inline tests into the methods, because, well, there weren't many methods 
other than Flask views.

>Ok this has gone one ***long enough!***

Honestly, I just need more practice typing Markdown. So here's a bulleted list of nothing:  
- I love animals
- I have 5 musical instruments
    1. An acoustic Guitar
    2. An acoustic/electric Guitar
    3. A travel sized acoustic guitar
    4. A Cajon (drum)
    5. A Dumbek (drum)
- This list has nothing to do with my code
- I didn't capitalize one of my iterations of the word "Guitar"
- It wasn't ^^^ that one
  

###### So in conclusion, I don't know why I'm still typing, nor do I know why you're reading this...
